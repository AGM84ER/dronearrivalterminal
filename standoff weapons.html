    <h1>Standoff Weapons</h1>
    <p>Munitions such as these, typically fall in the missile category. For our interest they can be further divided
        into:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>Cruise</h2>
        </li>
        Goes a little bit closer but typically more precise. This baby is typically launched from either a ship or an
        airplane,
        a mobile platform, so to speak. Pictured above is a great example of such human creation, <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGM-84H/K_SLAM-ER">SLAM-ER</a>.
        <li>
            <h2>Ballistic</h2>
        </li>
        Goes further, but may be less precise. These are typically launched by not-so-mobile platforms, meaning that we
        cannot
        physically get as close to adversary as we would like (as we would with the SLAM-ER). <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scud_missile">SCUDs</a> and <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OTR-21_Tochka">Tochka-Us</a> which we are in posession of, unfortunately
        not only not yield best results, as
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_rocket_attacks_on_Israel">Saddam's little adventure with Israel has
            shown</a>, but also create a lot of unnecessary collateral damage. With Saddam back in the early 90s, it
        produced a hell a lot of bang, but not much buck was made for it.
