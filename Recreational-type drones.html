    <h1>Recreational-type drones</h1>
    <p>Such as a typical quodrocopter-type, handheld recreational drone pictured above. Devices may be used either as
        mini-loitering munitions
        (kamikaze drones) or, be used to drop small munitions over particular object of interest. Range is typically
        very limited
        given inability to operate on a standoff basis and having a requirement to be in communication with the user
        (operated via remote control).
