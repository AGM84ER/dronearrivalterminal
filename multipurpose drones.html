    <p>These machines are typically of a higher value and usually expected to return to base after making delivery.
        Longetivity of such vehicles, lowers its operational costs.
        Success of delivery on high-value targets, makes these airacraft very desireable and worthy in our forces.
        One recent event showed a
        <a href="https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/UJ-22_Airborne_(%D0%91%D0%9F%D0%9B%D0%90)">Ukrainian UJ-22</a>, pictured
        above, while in
        service, this one unfortunately fell short of delivering the goodies on target.
        Nevertheless, it's comforting to see these babies already taking baby steps in service.
        Another one, is a famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baykar_Bayraktar_TB2">Turkish UAV</a>
        which has brought a lot of success to us in the beginning of last year's operations.
