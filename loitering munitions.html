    <h1>Loitering Munitions</h1>
    <p>Also known as the kamikaze drones, these are typically launched with an intent to deliver the party taking
        themselves with it.
        While it is not a loitering munition in its classical sense, the pictured above Tu-141 (originally designed to
        serve as a reconaissance drone)
        was used during an event known as <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyagilevo_and_Engels_air_bases_attacks">Engels Barbecue</a>
        This sort of employment is particularly desireble, in its economical sense of cost vs. benefit result. As the
        damage typically inflicted, is much more
        costly than the cost of delivering aircraft itself. To our unfortunate luck, <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HESA_Shahed_136">smany more</a>
        have stricken our side launched by adversary.
